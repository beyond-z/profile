Online profile for Beyond Z students
=======
This project is to prototype a Ruby on Rails project for a website where Beyond Z students can showcase the tasks they've completed in the leadership program. To start, we want to provide a site with the following capabilities:

- Login / signup
- Thumbnail image / avatar
- Summary
- Showcase of badges earned
    - Integration with Mozilla OpenBadges to earn them

We want to brand the online profile using the following doc: #TODO: insert doc with marketing assets#

For context, please see the one pager on our organization: Beyond Z One Pager.pdf

For more information and to brainstorm, please email brian.sadler@beyondz.org
